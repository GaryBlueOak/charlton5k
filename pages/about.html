                Welcome to the Charlton Heritage 5K Run/Walk.
                <br>
                <br>
Our race is held annually on Founders weekend and celebrates the founding of the Town of Charlton, NY. The race is just one of many fun and entertaining events scheduled for the Town of Charlton Founders weekend.
                <br>
                <br>
The race benefits the Charlton Historical Society and its mission to preserve the historical buildings and artifacts in the Town and to educate all who are interested in the history of our community.
                <br>
                <br>
The 5k course is a challenging mix of rolling hills and flats through the picturesque back roads of this sleepy rural Saratoga County hamlet. We start at the Old Red School House and complete the out and back course to finish at the beautiful St. Paul's Church built in 1804.
